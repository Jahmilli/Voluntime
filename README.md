### Running the Application
1. From the directory you want to download the application source code into, run:
```
# If you're not sure what protocol to download the application code with, see: https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use
# For cloning with HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Jahmilli/Voluntime.git

# For cloning with SSH
git clone git@github.com:Jahmilli/Voluntime.git
```
Open up Android Studio and select “Open an existing Android Studio project”. Search for the directory that you cloned and then expand it. Select Voluntime and click 'Open'.  
Wait for Gradle to sync all the files.  
Once the files are all synced, select 'Run' from the toolbar and select the device (If you haven't setup an Android Virtual Device (AVD), look at https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds for setting one up).  
The application will now start up and can be used __(If there's any issues, let the team know)__.
